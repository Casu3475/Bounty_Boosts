## Description

\#Summary:

A vulnerability has been identified in the Shardeum Core interface where attackers can manipulate URLs in displayed links by altering the ip parameter in the following endpoint:

\`http://localhost:3000/log?ip=example.com\&port=3000\`

This vulnerability can still lead to phishing attacks by misleading users into clicking external links that they believe to be part of the Shardeum interface.
