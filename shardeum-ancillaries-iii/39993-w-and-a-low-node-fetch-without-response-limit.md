## Description

## Brief/Intro

The archiver uses `node-fetch` without response size limits. This allows attackers to use up all the memory on the system until it crashes.

## Vulnerability Details

`node-fetch` should be called with a response limit. Since a limit is not supplied and `node-fetch` allows compressed responses, the counterparty can return a bunch of compressed stuff to use very little bandwith/transfer volume/resources to crash a node.

Please note that while the attacker does not initiate the attack itself, the victim has to make contact with other archivers/nodes to function (giving attackers the option to strike).

## Impact Details

Usually just the node process gets killed. In rare cases the OS also kills other processes.

## References

This happens on multiple occasions throughout the code. A search for "fetch(" probably finds all the instances.

## Notes

Since this bug is similar in nature to `39395` it makes sense to go through triage with that one first. Before resolving this bug.

## Proof of Concept

## Proof of Concept

The POC is very similar to: 39395

### steps

```
apt-get update
apt-get -y install git-core curl build-essential python3 vim 

wget -O "/tmp/compressed_34.json" "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cki/74224edfa2ba4dd2cdf78e4f229bcc38/raw/a14c7f76032f84ea0af2ae63c0e94df693611e80/gistfile1.txt"

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"

rustup install 1.74.1
rustup default 1.74.1

git clone https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum.git
cd shardeum && git checkout tags/bugbounty
nvm use 18.19.1
git apply debug-10-nodes.patch ( keeping the mode in release ) 
# manually edit src/config/index.ts -> flexibleRotationDelta: 0
npm ci ;
npm run prepare ; 
npm install -g shardus ;
npm update @shardus/archiver ;

git apply /tmp/shardeum-archiver-poc.patch

free -m
shardus start 1 pm2--no-autorestart # start one node and one archiver
shardus start 1 -a 1 pm2--no-autorestart # start a second archiver
```

### notes

Should your node have more than 16GB of RAM please use following link for the compressed\_34.json. It works up till 256GB of RAM.
