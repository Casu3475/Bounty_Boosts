## Description

## Brief/Intro

A fee calculation error has been identified in the \`withdraw\` function of the CollateralVault contract. The problem lies in how the withdrawal fee is computed, resulting in users being charged an excessive fee.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect calculation of fees in the \`withdraw\` function. The current implementation calculates the fee using: \`\`\`solidity uint256 fee = Pricing.percentageOf(\_amount, uint256(withdrawalFeeBasisPoints)); \`\`\` This approach applies the withdrawal fee to the entire amount, rather than correctly adjusting it using the configured \`withdrawalFeeBasisPoints\`. Consequently, users end up being charged a larger fee than intended. The correct implementation should utilize: \`\`\`solidity uint256 withdrawAmount = Pricing.amountBeforeFee(\_amount, withdrawalFeeBasisPoints); // real withdraw amount uint256 fee = \_amount - withdrawAmount ; // real fee amount \`\`\` This way, the fee aligns with the configured basis points, ensuring users pay an accurate withdrawal fee.

## Impact Details

If exploited or left unchecked, this bug leads to users being charged a higher fee than expected on each withdrawal. Over time, the cumulative overcharging could result in significant financial losses for the contract’s users, especially for high-value withdrawals. Furthermore, this discrepancy could erode user trust and damage the platform’s reputation.
