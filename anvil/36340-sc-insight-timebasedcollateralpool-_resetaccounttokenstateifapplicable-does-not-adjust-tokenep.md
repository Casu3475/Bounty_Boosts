## Description

## Brief/Intro

The TimeBasedCollateralPool \_resetAccountTokenStateIfApplicable is called in \_releaseEligibleAccountTokens to handle the case of a pool reset happening prior to the release that should affect the user. The function first handles the case of the account having a pending unstake that was already handled on the contract level before reset was called. In this case, the epoc pending units are first redeemed from the relevant epoc ExitBalance, and afterwards, if the account has additional pool units, they are redeemed from the reset exit balance:

(From TimeBasedCollateralPool.sol line 949) \`\`\`solidity // 2. Process and purge all account pending unstake state. There are two possibilities: // a. A pending unstake is vested or unvested but no vested contract unstake was processed prior to pool // reset. That contract state was purged in \_resetPool(...), the account pool units still exist in the // vault, and we can release them via the standard "everything has been unstaked" logic below. // b. A pending unstake, was vested and the contract unstake was already processed at the time of pool reset. // In this case, the exchange rate was captured in tokenEpochExitBalances, and it's unsafe to process // this unstake any different than the standard release process. uint256 unstakeUnitsToRelease; { uint256 epoch = accountStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeEpoch; if (epoch > 0) { uint256 currentEpoch = getCurrentEpoch(); if (epoch < currentEpoch) { // NB: This is case b. from above -- do not process contract-level unstakes that have not already been processed. (unstakeUnitsToRelease, \_tokensToRelease) = getAccountExitUnitsAndTokens( \_tokenAddress, epoch, accountStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeUnits, false ); epoch = accountStateStorage.secondPendingUnstakeEpoch; if (\_nonZeroAndLessThan(epoch, currentEpoch)) { (uint256 units, uint256 tokens) = getAccountExitUnitsAndTokens( \_tokenAddress, epoch, accountStateStorage.secondPendingUnstakeUnits, false ); unstakeUnitsToRelease += units; \_tokensToRelease += tokens; } }

```
        accountStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeEpoch &#x3D; 0;
        accountStateStorage.secondPendingUnstakeEpoch &#x3D; 0;

        accountStateStorage.firstPendingUnstakeUnits &#x3D; 0;
        accountStateStorage.secondPendingUnstakeUnits &#x3D; 0;
    }
}

// 3. Process reset exit units.
if (_unitsToRelease &#x3D;&#x3D; unstakeUnitsToRelease) {
```

\`\`\`

## Vulnerability Details

The problem is that is this scenario, while the user receives their releasable tokens for their pending epoc units, the ExitBalance struct is not updated and the released tokens/units are not substracted from it. This is inconistent with the way release is handled in the regular case (without a following reset), where the ExitBalance leftTokens/leftUnits are reduced with each account release: (From TimeBasedCollateralPool.sol line 845, \_processAccountTokenUnstakes function) \`\`\`solidity /\*\* Update epoch-exit state \*\*/ tokenEpochExitBalances\[\_tokenAddress]\[epoch].unitsLeft -= \_unitsToRelease; tokenEpochExitBalances\[\_tokenAddress]\[epoch].tokensLeft -= \_tokensToRelease; \`\`\`

One of the sideeffects of this inconsistency in release calculations is that while the regular release process guarantees that all the exit balance tokens for that epoc will be distributed to users , in the reset case some residual exit balance remains unclaimable and permanently locked in the TBCP's vault account. The reason is that in the regular release process each user gets their share calculated from the reminder, up to the last user that gets all remaining tokens. In the reset case however, each user's share is calculated from the overall exit balance units/tokens. This causes rounding-down inacuraccies to accumulate and causes a situation that even after all units are claimed, not all exit balance tokens are transferred to the claimers (as vault available balance). Since the entire exit amount is released to the TBCP available balance, these residual tokens will remain in the TBCP vault available balance and will be locked there permanently.

## Impact Details

Some residual tokens remain locked in the CollateralVault as residual TBCP available balance, accumulating over time.

## Proof of Concept

## Proof of Concept

### run instructions

This test was written in foundry. To run:

1. Install foundry and create a foundry project with \`forge init\`
2. cd to the project folder and install openzeppelin with \`forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\` and \`forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable\`
3. Copy all files from the audit repo \`contracts\` folder to the foundry project \`src\` folder
4. Copy the following folders from the audit repo \`node-modules\` folder to the foundry \`lib\` folder: @pythnetwork, @uniswap
5. Add the following mappings to foundry.toml: remappings = \["@openzeppelin/contracts=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts","@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradable=lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradable/contracts","@forge-std=lib/forge-std/src",]
6. Create a test file under the foundry \`test\` folder and copy the code below to it (replace YOUR\_MAINNET\_FORK\_URL with your alchemy/other service url).
7. run \`forge test -vvv --match-test testReleaseAfterReset\`
8. Run once with the with\_reset variable set to true and once as false to see the different effect.
