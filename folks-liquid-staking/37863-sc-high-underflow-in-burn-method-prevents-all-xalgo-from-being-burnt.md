# #37863 \[SC-High] Underflow in burn method prevents all xALGO from being burnt

**Submitted on Dec 17th 2024 at 19:47:02 UTC by @uhudo for** [**Audit Comp | Folks: Liquid Staking**](https://immunefi.com/audit-competition/folks-finance-liquid-staking-audit-competition)

* **Report ID:** #37863
* **Report Type:** Smart Contract
* **Report severity:** High
* **Target:** https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algo-liquid-staking-contracts/blob/8bd890fde7981335e9b042a99db432e327681e1a/contracts/xalgo/consensus\_v2.py
* **Impacts:**
  * Temporary freezing of funds for at least 1 hour

## Description

## Brief/Intro

A portion of minted xALGO cannot be burned, leading to users losing their funds. Currently, about 111,000 ALGO on Mainnet would not be able to be burnt.

## Vulnerability Details

The problem arises in `burn` method (https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algo-liquid-staking-contracts/blob/8bd890fde7981335e9b042a99db432e327681e1a/contracts/xalgo/consensus\_v2.py#L793) due to a possible underflow at L824 (https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algo-liquid-staking-contracts/blob/8bd890fde7981335e9b042a99db432e327681e1a/contracts/xalgo/consensus\_v2.py#L824). The underflow happens because the ALGO to be returned during the burn is allocated only from the `total_active_stake`, while the xALGO in reality represents also the portion of ALGO that have been received by the protocol as part of the staking rewards `total_reward`. Because the smart contract remains upgradable, a future smart contract upgrade could possibly recover these funds.

## Impact Details

The amount of xALGO that cannot be burnt is increasing with the reward that the protocol is getting, i.e. `xALGO_{lost} = xALGO_{minted} * (R-U)/(A+R-U)`, where `A` is the `total_active_stake`, `R` the `total_reward`, and `U` the `total_unclaimed_fees`. Based on the current state of the Algorand Mainnet (application ID: 1134695678 (https://lora.algokit.io/mainnet/application/1134695678)), this would result in about 111,000 ALGO being lost by users that are last to burn their xALGO.

## Proof of Concept

## Proof of Concept

The test demonstrating that not all xALGO can be burned is implemented in `burn_test.py`, found in https://www.swisstransfer.com/d/4c5dff62-e56b-4c13-bc07-0bbba1e00e84 (password is NT4SCGJ7NTJENGSDWKKLZLZ2J):
