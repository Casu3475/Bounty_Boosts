* **Report ID:** #37867
* **Report Type:** Smart Contract
* **Report severity:** Low
* **Target:** https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algo-liquid-staking-contracts/blob/8bd890fde7981335e9b042a99db432e327681e1a/contracts/xalgo/consensus\_v2.py
* **Impacts:**
  * Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description

## Brief/Intro

The code is not being transparently upgradable through scheduling an upgrade, as well as the upgrade potentially failing - without blocking the protocol.

## Vulnerability Details

The code can be upgraded by admin via a two-step process, i.e. by calling `schedule_update_sc` method to schedule an update and then calling the method `update_sc` to deploy it. The scheduling makes commitments in the form of hashes of the smart contract code, i.e. the approval and clear programs, which are to be uploaded later. If the method `update_sc` is called with programs that do not meet the hash commitments, the update will be rejected. The update can succeed only if the call is made after a predefined amount of time, which is set to 1 day.

The purpose of this two-step process is to give users the option to review the new contract changes and act by burning their xALGO before the new update goes live e.g. if they do not agree with the changes or find them malicious. The downside of the current implementation is that it still requires the admin to publish somewhere the code, which corresponds to the commitments made, for the users to review.

Moreover, the implementation includes an error. The maximum size of programs on Algorand is 8192 bytes. However, the maximum byte width of the Algorand Virtual Machine is 4096 bytes. This means that when verifying whether the correct programs are to be deployed after they have been scheduled, the calculation of hashes of programs larger than 4096 bytes will fail, i.e. at https://github.com/Folks-Finance/algo-liquid-staking-contracts/blob/8bd890fde7981335e9b042a99db432e327681e1a/contracts/xalgo/consensus\_v2.py#L353. Because a pending upgrade can be overwritten by the admin calling again `schedule_update_sc` method, the error will not result in a blocked contract.

## Impact Details

The centralization fear is one of the main downsides of liquid staking protocols and a big reason why many users do not want to use them. Any effort that can be made to improve decentralization will drive additional users to the protocol.

To resolve both of these limitations simultaneously, the contract could take advantage of box storage to store the code for the new upgrade already in the update scheduling step.
