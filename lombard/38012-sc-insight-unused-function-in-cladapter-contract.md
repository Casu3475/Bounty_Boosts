# #38012 \[SC-Insight] Unused Function in CLAdapter Contract

**Submitted on Dec 21st 2024 at 17:11:08 UTC by @IlIlHunterlIlI for** [**Audit Comp | Lombard**](https://immunefi.com/audit-competition/audit-comp-lombard)

* **Report ID:** #38012
* **Report Type:** Smart Contract
* **Report severity:** Insight
* **Target:** https://github.com/lombard-finance/evm-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/bridge/adapters/CLAdapter.sol
* **Impacts:**
  * Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description

## Brief/Intro

The `initWithdrawalNoSignatures` function in CLAdapter.sol has the `onlyTokenPool` modifier but is never called from the `TokenPool` contract or any other location in the codebase. This creates dead code that increases contract size and gas costs unnecessarily while potentially creating confusion about the security model around signature-less withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Details

The function is defined in CLAdapter.sol:

```solidity
function initWithdrawalNoSignatures(
    uint64 remoteSelector,
    bytes calldata onChainData
) external onlyTokenPool returns (uint64) {
    _receive(getChain[remoteSelector], onChainData);
    return bridge.withdraw(onChainData);
}
```

Key observations:

1. The function has `onlyTokenPool` modifier meaning only the TokenPool contract can call it
2. Examining TokenPool.sol shows no calls to this function
3. The function allows withdrawals without signature verification unlike `initiateWithdrawal`

## Impact Details

While this is not an exploitable vulnerability since the function is protected by `onlyTokenPool`, it has several negative impacts:

1. Increased deployment costs due to unnecessary bytecode
2. Potential future security risks if the function is accidentally used instead of the signature-verified version

my foundry.toml

```
[profile.default]
src = 'contracts'
out = 'out'
libs = ['node_modules', 'lib']
test = 'test'
remappings = [
    'ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/',
    'forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/'
]
```

and this is how i got the environment to be in foundry

```
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-foundry
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-foundry";
npx hardhat init-foundry
```
