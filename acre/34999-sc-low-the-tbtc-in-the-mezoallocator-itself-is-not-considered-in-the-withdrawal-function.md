## Description

## Brief/Intro

\`tBTC\` deposited into \`StBTC\` is routed through the \`MezoAllocator\` to the \`Portal\`. When \`depositors\` want to \`withdraw\` \`tBTC\` from \`StBTC\`, and if \`StBTC\` lacks sufficient \`tBTC\`, it \`withdraws\` the necessary amount from the \`Portal\` via the \`MezoAllocator\`. However, \`tBTC\` held in the \`MezoAllocator\` itself but not yet \`deposited\` to the \`Portal\` is not accounted for, which can lead to an \`arithmetic underflow\` during the \`withdrawal\` process.

## Vulnerability Details

The \`total assets\` of \`StBTC\` consist of three parts: its \`balance\`, the \`total assets\` of the \`MezoAllocator\`, and \`total debts\`. \`\`\` function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {     return         IERC20(asset()).balanceOf(address(this)) +         dispatcher.totalAssets() +         totalDebt; } \`\`\` The \`MezoAllocator\`'s \`total assets\` include its \`balance\` and the amount \`deposited\` in the \`Portal\`. \`\`\` function totalAssets() external view returns (uint256) {     return depositBalance + tbtc.balanceOf(address(this)); } \`\`\` During a \`withdrawal\`, if \`StBTC\`'s current \`tBTC\` \`balance\` is insufficient, it attempts to \`withdraw\` the required amount from the \`Portal\`. \`\`\` function withdraw(     uint256 assets,     address receiver,     address owner ) public override returns (uint256) {     uint256 currentAssetsBalance = IERC20(asset()).balanceOf(address(this));     uint256 assetsWithFees = assets + \_feeOnRaw(assets, exitFeeBasisPoints);     if (assetsWithFees > currentAssetsBalance) {         dispatcher.withdraw(assetsWithFees - currentAssetsBalance);     }     return super.withdraw(assets, receiver, owner); } \`\`\` The \`withdraw\` function assumes that the requested amount is less than the amount \`deposited\` in the \`Portal\`. However, \`tBTC\` that hasn’t been \`deposited\` into the \`Portal\` yet—such as donated tokens or rewards—is not considered. As a result, the requested withdrawal amount could exceed the \`Portal\`'s \`deposits\` but still be less than the \`total assets\` of the \`MezoAllocator\`. \`\`\` function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {     if (msg.sender != address(stbtc)) revert CallerNotStbtc();

&#x20;   if (amount < depositBalance) {         mezoPortal.withdrawPartially(             address(tbtc),             depositId,             uint96(amount)         );     } else {         mezoPortal.withdraw(address(tbtc), depositId);     }     depositBalance -= uint96(amount); // @audit: underflow when amount > depositBalance     tbtc.safeTransfer(address(stbtc), amount); } \`\`\` This discrepancy can cause a \`withdrawal\` failure due to \`underflow\`, effectively locking users' funds until the next \`allocation\` by \`MezoAllocator\` \`maintainers\`.

## Impact Details

The impact is clear, as it can lead to a denial of service (DoS) and lock users' funds.

## Recommendation

\`\`\` function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {     if (msg.sender != address(stbtc)) revert CallerNotStbtc();

&#x20;   if (amount < depositBalance) {         mezoPortal.withdrawPartially(             address(tbtc),             depositId,             uint96(amount)         );     } else {         mezoPortal.withdraw(address(tbtc), depositId);     } -    depositBalance -= uint96(amount);

* depositBalance = depositBalance > uint96(amount) ? depositBalance - uint96(amount) : 0;     tbtc.safeTransfer(address(stbtc), amount); } \`\`\`

## Proof of Concept

## Proof of Concept

Add below test to the \`stBTC.test.ts\`: \`\`\` describe("withdraw from portal", () => { it("should withdraw from the dispatcher", async () => { const assets = to1e18(100) await tbtc.mint(depositor1.address, assets) await tbtc.connect(depositor1).approve(await stbtc.getAddress(), assets) await stbtc.connect(depositor1).deposit(assets, depositor1.address)

```
await mezoAllocator.connect(maintainer).allocate()

/**
 * some tbtc are not deposited to the Portal
 */
await tbtc.mint(await mezoAllocator.getAddress(), to1e18(1))

const shares &#x3D; await stbtc.balanceOf(depositor1.address) 
/**
 *  reverted with below error
 *  Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation overflowed outside of an unchecked block)
 */
await stbtc.connect(depositor1).redeem(shares, depositor1.address, depositor1.address)
```

}) }) \`\`\`
